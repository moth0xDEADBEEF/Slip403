# Slip403

**Slip403** is a modular 403 bypass scanner built for ethical hackers, bug bounty hunters, and red teamers.  
It automates access control testing using path manipulation, header injection, method variation, and response fingerprinting.
This tool will (intentionally) not fly under the radar as it is never meant to be used out of scope or to attack unknowing targets.

- ‚úÖ Baseline detection to identify meaningful bypasses
- ‚úÖ SHA-256 response hashing to reduce false positives
- ‚úÖ Optional response saving for successful 200s
- ‚úÖ Fully modular CLI, Python 3.8+
